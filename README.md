Lung Cancer Detection Using CNN and Grad-CAM Explanations
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for detecting lung cancer from medical images (e.g., histopathological scans or chest X-rays) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It includes Grad-CAM visual explanations and prediction reporting for enhanced model interpretability.

Features
CNN model trained to classify images as "Cancer" or "Normal"

Per-image prediction logging with confidence scores

Grad-CAM heatmap generation for visual explanations

Human-readable explanation text based on model attention

Evaluation results saved as a CSV report

Option to upload dataset (including images and metadata) to the Hugging Face Hub:
